# Workpoint 1 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Update tockloader (install from source)

In `/home/tock/tock` run:

```bash
tock@tock-dev:~/tock/tock$ pip3 uninstall tockloader
# close and reopen the shell
tock@tock-dev:~/tock/tock$ git clone https://github.com/tock/tockloader.git
tock@tock-dev:~/tock/tock$ cd tockloader
tock@tock-dev:~/tock/tock$ python3 setup.py install
```

Connect the board and run:

```bash
tock@tock-dev:~/tock/tock$ tockloader list-known-boards
# outputs this
Known boards:
  ...
  - stm32f4discovery     STM32F4-based Discovery Boards
  ...
```

---

# Workpoint 2 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

List the board info and installed apps from your board. Add these options at the end:

```bash
$ tockloader ... --openocd --board stm32f4discovery
```

# Workpoint 3 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

1. Write and upload and app that faults. Use `tockloader`.
```c
int main(void)
{
      int *s = NULL;
      *s = 0;
      return 0;
}
```

2. Upload the `blink` app using `tockloader`.
 - Does it work? Explain.

3. Modify the app fault policy so that it does not panic when an app faults
  - hint: `main.rs` serach for `FAULT_RESPONSE`.

Use the proecess console to show the details for the apps.

# Scheduler

The `Scheduler` trait

- Round Robun
- Cooperative
- Priority Queue

```rust
/// Trait which any scheduler must implement.

    ///

2. Command
3. Allow
4. Memop

.card[.small[![subscribe](../images/sep_subscribe.png)]]
.card[.small[![command](../images/sep_command.png)]]

.card[.small[![memop](../images/sep_memop.png)]]
.card[.small[![returncode](../images/sep_returncode.png)]]
]

---

## 0: Yield

Yield transitions the current process from the Running to the Yielded state, and
the process will not execute again until another callback re-schedules the
process.

If a process has enqueued callbacks waiting to execute when Yield is called, the
process immediately re-enters the Running state and the first callback runs.

```rust
yield()
```

##### Arguments

None.

##### Return

None.

---

## 1: Subscribe

Subscribe assigns callback functions to be executed in response to various
events.
- a callback function has a *callback ID* (`driver`,`subscribe_number`), 
- null pointer disables the callback

```rust
subscribe(driver: u32, subscribe_number: u32, callback: u32, userdata: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

##### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver to call.
 - `subscribe_number`: An integer index for which function is being subscribed.
 - `callback`: A pointer to a callback function to be executed when this event
 occurs. `void callback(int arg1, int arg2, int arg3, void* data)`.
 - `userdata`: A pointer to a value of any type that will be passed back

##### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `subscribe_number`.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

## 2: Command

Command instructs the driver to perform a specific action.

```rust
command(driver: u32, command_number: u32, argument1: u32, argument2: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver to call.
 - `command_number`: An integer specifying the requested command.
 - `argument1`: A command-specific argument.
 - `argument2`: A command-specific argument.

- One Tock convention with the Command syscall is that command number 0 will
always return a value of 0 or greater if the driver is supported.

#### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `command_number`.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

## 3: Allow

Allow shares memory buffers between the kernel and application.
- null pointer revokes sharing a region.

```rust
allow(driver: u32, allow_number: u32, pointer: usize, size: u32) -> ReturnCode as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `driver`: An integer specifying which driver should be granted access.
 - `allow_number`: A driver-specific integer specifying the purpose of this
   buffer.
 - `pointer`: A pointer to the start of the buffer in the process memory space.
 - `size`: An integer number of bytes specifying the length of the buffer.

#### Return

 - `ENODEVICE` if `driver` does not refer to a valid kernel driver.
 - `ENOSUPPORT` if the driver exists but doesn't support the `allow_number`.
 - `EINVAL` the buffer referred to by `pointer` and `size` lies completely or
partially outside of the processes addressable RAM.
 - Other return codes based on the specific driver.

---

## 4: Memop

Memop expands the memory segment available to the process, allows the process to
retrieve pointers to its allocated memory space, provides a mechanism for
the process to tell the kernel where its stack and heap start, and other
operations involving process memory.

```rust
memop(op_type: u32, argument: u32) -> [[ VARIES ]] as u32
```

#### Arguments

 - `op_type`: An integer indicating whether this is a `brk` (0), a `sbrk` (1),
   or another memop call.
 - `argument`: The argument to `brk`, `sbrk`, or other call.

Each memop operation is specific and details of each call can be found in
the [memop syscall documentation](syscalls/memop.md).

#### Return

- Dependent on the particular memop call.

# Workpoint 4 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Enable the system calls trace in `kernel/src/config.rs`. 
1. Upload and app that prints a text on the shell using `printf`. 
  - How many system calls is printf using?
  - What is the driver number of the driver used for printing?

2. Upload the blink app and look at the system calls trace.
  - What is led's driver number?

## Hello Driver

Kernel

1. Write the `Hello` and its implementatiom
2. Impelement the `Driver` trait for `Hello`
  - all methiods have default implementation
3. Add the driver to the board structure in `main.rs`

User space

- Implement the system calls

---
### Kernel

Write the driver and implement the`Driver` trait (1 and 2).

Write a file `hello.rs` in the same folder as `main.rs`.

```rust
use kernel::{Driver, AppId, ReturnCode};

/// Each driver is identified by a unique number
///
/// numbers higher than 0xa0000000 are unused by standard drivers
pub const DRIVER_NUM: usize = 0xa0000000;

/// The Hello structure
pub struct Hello {}


/// The hello implementation
impl Hello {
    pub fn new() -> Hello {
        Hello {}
    }
}

/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation

    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,

            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```

---
### Kernel

Register the driver for in the board's structure (3)

In `main.rs` 

```rust
/// use the driver module
mod hello;

---
### User space

In your application's folder

hello.h
```c
#pargma once

#define HELLO_DRIVER_NUMBER 0xa0000000

bool hello_is_available (void);

```

hello.c
```c
#include "hello.h"
#include <tock.h>

bool hello_is_available (void) {
    if (command (HELLO_DRIVER_NUMBER, 0, 0, 0) == TOCK_SUCCESS) {
        return true;
    } else {
        return false;
    }
}
```

---
## Workpoint 5 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Add `command_num` 1 to the driver and print a text on the shell when it is called.

```rust
/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {
    /// subscribe and allow will use the default implementation

    /// command syscall
    fn command(&self, command_num: usize, _data1: usize, _data2: usize, _app_id: AppId) -> ReturnCode {
        match command_num {
            // command_num 0 is used to verify if the driver exists
            0 => ReturnCode::SUCCESS,
            1 => // ...

            // the command number is not defined
            _ => ReturnCode::ENOSUPPORT,
        }
    }
}
```

Add a function for it in the header and source file in userspace. 
Write and upload an app that userspac the driver.

---
## Workpoint 6 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

Add command_number 2 that will increment a counter and return it to the app.
  Hint: use `ReturnCode::SuccessWithValue { value: ... }`

Each time the app calls the system call, the driver will will return an incremented number.

```c
#include "hello.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <timer.h>

int nr;

int main(void) {
    while (true) {
        nr = hello_counter ();
        printf ("Counter %d\n", i);
        delay_ms (1000);
    }
}
```

Hint: store the current number in the `Hello` structure.

---
# Mutability

All Tock traits use `&self` to be able to share a driver with several other drivers.

Interior mutability:
- Cell<T> (`core::cell::Cell`)
- OptionalCell<T> (`kernel::common:cells::OptionalCell`)
- TakeCell<T> (`kernel::common::cells::TakeCell`)

.card[.small_vertical[![OptionalCell](../images/sep_optionalcell.png)]]
.card[.small_vertical[![TakeCell](../images/sep_takecell.png)]]
]

---

## Cell

Store a mutable value inside a immutable structure

```rust
use kernel::{Driver, AppId, ReturnCode};
use core::cell::Cell;

/// Each driver is identified by a unique number
///
/// numbers higher than 0xa0000000 are unused by standard drivers
pub const DRIVER_NUM: usize = 0xa0000000;

/// The Hello structure
pub struct Hello {
    nr: Cell<usize>
}


/// The hello implementation
impl Hello {
    pub fn new() -> Hello {
        Hello {
            nr: Cell::new (0)
        }
    }
}

/// The driver system calls implementation
impl Driver for Hello {

## Pin

Use the pin as an Output

```rust
pub trait Pin: Input + Output + Configure {}

/// Control and configure a GPIO pin.
pub trait Configure {
    // ...
    
    /// Make the pin an output, returning the current configuration,
    /// which should be either `Configuration::Output` or
    /// `Configuration::InputOutput`.
    fn make_output(&self) -> Configuration;
    
    /// Disable the pin as an output, returning the current configuration.
    fn disable_output(&self) -> Configuration;

    /// Make the pin an input, returning the current configuration,
    // ...
}

pub trait Output {
    /// Set the GPIO pin high. If the pin is not an output or
    /// input/output, this call is ignored.
    fn set(&self);

    /// Set the GPIO pin low. If the pin is not an output or
    /// input/output, this call is ignored.
    fn clear(&self);

    /// Toggle the GPIO pin. If the pin was high, set it low. If
    /// the pin was low, set it high. If the pin is not an output or
    /// input/output, this call is ignored. Return the new value
    /// of the pin.
    fn toggle(&self) -> bool;

    // ...
}
```

---
## Use an Output Pin in a driver

Send it to the driver in the new function

```rust
use kernel::hil::gpio::Pin;
use kernel::{Driver, ReturnCode, AppId};

pub const DRIVER_NUM: usize = 0xa000001;

pub struct SevenSeg {
    pin: &'static dyn Pin,
    // ...
}
impl SevenSeg {
    pub fn new (pin: &'static dyn Pin) -> SevenSeg {
        pin.make_output ();
        SevenSeg {
            pin: pin
        }
    }
}
impl Driver for SevenSeg {
    // ...
}

```

---
## Instantiate the driver

Connect the one of the pins to the driver in `main.rs`.

```rust
mod sevenseg;

//...

#[no_mangle]
pub unsafe fn reset_handler() {
    // ...
    use stm32f412g::gpio::PinId;
    let sevenseg = static_init!(
        sevenseg::SevenSeg,
        sevenseg::SevenSeg::new(PinId::PA01.get_pin().as_ref().unwrap())
    );
    // ...
}
```

## Workpoint 7 .top_image[![Work In Progress](../images/work_in_progress.png)]

1. Write a driver and a user space API for showing one digit on the 7 segement display.
2. Write a user space application that displays a multi digit number by displaying very fast every digit

| Command Num | Parameters | Description |
|-------------|------------|-------------|
| 0 | N/A | Returns 0 if the driver is available |
| 1 | on | the display turns on and display the number |
| 2 | off | the display turns off and does not display anything |
| 3 | data1: digit (0-9)<br>data2: position (0-3) | set the number to display |
| 4 | N/A | get the displayed number |
| 5 | N/A | get the position |
